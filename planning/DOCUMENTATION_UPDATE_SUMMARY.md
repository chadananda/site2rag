# Documentation Update Summary

## Overview

Updated all documentation files to reflect the current state of the codebase, focusing on PDF/binary file handling, progress tracking, and the simplified sliding window implementation.

## Files Updated

### 1. README.md
- Added notes about PDFs being tracked as first-class pages in the database
- Added binary file change detection capabilities
- Clarified that progress bar accurately shows remaining pages with --limit flag
- Updated Document Download Support section with database integration details

### 2. planning/prd.md
- Updated Asset Management section to include binary files as pages
- Added binary change detection and progress tracking for PDFs
- Updated database schema to show PDF tracking columns (is_pdf, pdf_conversion_status, pdf_md_path)
- Enhanced Progress Tracking section with notes about --limit accuracy and AI request tracking

### 3. planning/PERFORMANCE_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
- Added update section about the simplified sliding window implementation
- Noted the move from caching to pure parallelization
- Documented the ~10x performance improvement

### 4. planning/TEST_COVERAGE_GAPS.md
- Added missing test coverage items for binary file tracking
- Noted that PDFs are tracked as first-class pages in database
- Added PDF metadata tracking columns to test requirements

### 5. src/REFACTORING_MAP.md
- Added context_processor_simple.js to the HIGH RISK section
- Documented the main functions in the simplified sliding window processor
- Updated the test coverage notes for the new implementation

### 6. CLAUDE.md
- Updated the fallback order to remove gpt4o-mini (as per recent changes)
- Confirmed Claude 3.5 Haiku as the default provider

## Key Features Now Documented

1. **PDF/Binary File Support**:
   - PDFs and binary files are tracked as first-class pages
   - Change detection works for binary files
   - Database tracks PDF conversion status and paths

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Progress bar accurately reflects --limit parameter
   - Binary files included in crawl counts
   - AI enhancement shown as separate progress

3. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Simplified sliding window implementation
   - No caching complexity, pure parallelization
   - ~10x faster than previous implementations

4. **AI Processing**:
   - Default to Claude 3.5 Haiku
   - Simplified fallback chain without gpt4o-mini
   - Plain text response format with strict validation

## Remaining Documentation Gaps

While most documentation has been updated, there are a few areas that could benefit from additional documentation:

1. **Binary File Conversion Pipeline**: The actual PDF-to-markdown conversion process is not fully documented
2. **Progress Bar Implementation Details**: The exact calculations for progress with limits could be documented
3. **Change Detection for Binary Files**: The specific mechanism for detecting binary file changes

These gaps represent future enhancements rather than current functionality, as the code review suggests these features are tracked in the database but not fully implemented yet.
