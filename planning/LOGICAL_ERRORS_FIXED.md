# Logical Errors Fixed (2024-06-24)

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Memory Leak in AI Sessions**

- **Problem**: Temporary AI sessions weren't being cleaned up on errors
- **Fix**: Added `finally` block to ensure cleanup happens regardless of success/failure
- **File**: `src/core/ai_client_v2.js`

### 2. **Delay Calculation Issue**

- **Problem**: Linear delay growth (batch 100 = 5 seconds delay)
- **Fix**: Use modulo-based staggering (0-360ms spread across 10 concurrent slots)
- **File**: `src/core/context_processor_unified_v2.js`

### 3. **Progress Bar Updates Before Work**

- **Problem**: Progress callback called before any actual work started
- **Fix**: Removed premature progress update, only update after batch completion
- **File**: `src/core/context_processor_unified_v2.js`

### 4. **Eligible URLs Not Updated in Sitemap Mode**

- **Problem**: In sitemap-first mode, eligible URLs weren't being tracked properly
- **Fix**: Added progress update for sitemap mode as well
- **File**: `src/services/crawl_service.js`

### 5. **AI Request Count Estimation**

- **Problem**: Didn't account for retries in total request calculation
- **Fix**: Added 20% buffer to account for potential retries
- **File**: `src/core/context_processor_unified_v2.js`

### 6. **Progress Bar Dynamic Total Updates**

- **Problem**: Progress bar couldn't handle dynamic total updates properly
- **Fix**: Added check to update total if it changes during processing
- **File**: `src/utils/progress.js`

### 7. **Unused Variables**

- **Problem**: Created variables that weren't used (lint errors)
- **Fix**: Removed unused `batches` and `blocksPerWindow` variables
- **File**: `src/core/context_processor_unified_v2.js`

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Batch Retry Accounting**: When batches fail and retry with fewer blocks, the total AI request count increases. The 20% buffer helps but may not be sufficient for heavily erroring documents.

2. **Window Coverage**: The estimation logic for windows may not perfectly match actual window creation, but the dynamic progress bar updates help compensate.

3. **Concurrency vs Delays**: The staggered delays now properly cycle through 10 slots matching the aiLimiter concurrency, preventing thundering herd issues.

## Performance Impact

- Memory leaks fixed = more stable long-running processes
- Better delay calculation = faster overall processing
- Accurate progress tracking = better user experience
- Proper cleanup = reduced memory usage

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with documents that cause many retries
2. Test with very large documents (100+ windows)
3. Monitor memory usage during long runs
4. Verify progress bar accuracy across different document sizes
