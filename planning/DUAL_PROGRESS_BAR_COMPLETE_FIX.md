# Complete Dual Progress Bar Fix

## Issues Fixed

1. **"Preparing content for AI enhancement" message appearing in dual mode**
   - Root cause: The multibar was being initialized in the constructor, causing `startProcessing` to find an existing multibar but no bars, triggering single bar mode
   - Fix: Moved multibar initialization to `start()` method where it belongs

2. **Dual progress bars breaking into single bar after parallel processing**
   - Root cause: `completeProcessing()` was destroying the entire multibar container
   - Fix: Modified to only update AI bar to 100% in dual mode without destroying container

3. **Token tracking not working**
   - Root cause: `callAI()` was discarding usage data for plain text responses
   - Fix: Modified to return both content and usage data

4. **Header spacing**
   - Added empty line at top inside the header box as requested

## Key Changes

### 1. progress.js Constructor
```javascript
// Before: multibar was created in constructor
this.multibar = new cliProgress.MultiBar(...);

// After: multibar initialized as null
this.multibar = null;
```

### 2. startProcessing() Method
- Added early detection for calls before progress bars exist
- Stores pending AI config to be used when bars are created
- Suppresses "Preparing content" message when `pendingAIConfig` exists

### 3. completeProcessing() Method
- In dual mode: only updates AI bar to 100%, keeps multibar alive
- In single mode: stops and clears multibar as before

### 4. start() Method
- Uses `pendingAIConfig` if available when creating AI bar
- Ensures proper total is set from the beginning

## Result
- Clean dual progress bar display throughout entire process
- No disruptive messages between progress bars
- Proper token tracking with "X tokens | $X.XX" format
- Bars remain aligned and properly formatted
