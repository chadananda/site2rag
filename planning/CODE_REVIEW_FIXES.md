# Code Review Fixes for AI Context Optimization

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Resource Leak in Session Management (ai_client_v2.js)

**Problem**: Temporary sessions created in `callAI` were never cleaned up, causing memory leaks. **Fix**: Added proper cleanup in both success and error paths using try-finally pattern.

### 2. Block Mapping Logic Error (context_processor_unified_v2.js)

**Problem**: Window block indices were incorrectly mapped to keyed blocks, causing wrong text to be processed. **Fix**:

- Modified `createKeyedBlocks` to return both blocks and a mapping (key -> original index)
- Fixed window processing to correctly map block indices
- Fixed block reconstruction to use proper mapping

### 3. Window Session Error Handling

**Problem**: Window sessions weren't cleaned up on errors, causing resource leaks. **Fix**: Added try-catch-finally blocks to ensure sessions are always closed.

### 4. Validation Return Type Inconsistency

**Problem**: `validateEnhancement` returned boolean in some cases and object in others. **Fix**: Standardized to always return `{isValid: boolean, error: string|null}`.

### 5. Error Context Improvements

**Problem**: Errors didn't indicate which batch/window failed. **Fix**: Added contextual information to error messages.

## Remaining Considerations

### 1. Concurrency Control

With 10 concurrent calls and multiple windows, we could hit rate limits. Consider:

- Adding per-window rate limiting
- Implementing backpressure when queue is full

### 2. Memory Optimization

Each window caches the full context. For large documents with many windows, consider:

- Sharing base instructions across sessions
- Implementing session pooling

### 3. Validation Flexibility

The current validation is very strict. Consider:

- Allowing minor whitespace differences
- Handling edge cases like smart quotes

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with documents that have:
   - Many small blocks (< 160 chars)
   - Very large windows
   - Edge cases in text normalization

2. Monitor:
   - Memory usage during processing
   - Session cleanup effectiveness
   - Error recovery behavior

3. Verify:
   - Block mapping correctness
   - Window overlap handling
   - Cache hit rates with Anthropic

## Performance Impact

The fixes ensure:

- No memory leaks from unclosed sessions
- Correct block processing (no data corruption)
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Clean resource management

These fixes maintain all the performance optimizations while ensuring correctness and stability.
