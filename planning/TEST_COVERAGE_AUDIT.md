# Test Coverage Audit Report

## Date: 2025-01-26

## Summary

Comprehensive test coverage audit completed for the site2rag project. Created new test files and enhanced existing tests to cover critical functionality, edge cases, and security concerns.

## Test Files Created

### 1. `/tests/unit/utils/progress.test.js`
- **Coverage**: Progress bar functionality and edge cases
- **Key Areas Tested**:
  - maxPages handling (0, null, undefined, negative values)
  - Concurrent update safety
  - Progress bar lifecycle (start, update, stop)
  - AI processing phase tracking
  - URL tracking and completion statuses
  - Time calculations and estimations
  - Error handling during progress operations
  - Re-crawl mode statistics

### 2. `/tests/unit/services/crawl-service-binary-edge-cases.test.js`
- **Coverage**: Binary file handling edge cases and security
- **Key Areas Tested**:
  - Binary file duplicate detection by content hash
  - Path traversal attack prevention
  - File type verification
  - Network error handling (timeouts, 404s, redirect loops)
  - Resource URL detection with query parameters
  - Oversized file rejection
  - Cross-domain duplicate detection
  - Special character sanitization in filenames

### 3. `/tests/unit/utils/errors.test.js`
- **Coverage**: Custom error classes
- **Key Areas Tested**:
  - CrawlLimitReached error
  - CrawlAborted error
  - InvalidUrlError with URL storage
  - Error interoperability with promises
  - Error prototype chain integrity
  - Error usage patterns and scenarios

## Missing Test Coverage Identified

2. `src/core/ai_config.js`
3. `src/core/context_enrichment.js`
4. `src/core/context_processor.js`
5. `src/core/context_processor_secure.js`
6. `src/core/crawl_state.js`
7. `src/core/parallel_ai_processor.js`
8. `src/core/site_state.js`
9. `src/services/debug_logger.js`
10. `src/services/logger_service.js`
11. `src/utils/dom_utils.js`
12. `src/utils/performance.js`
13. `src/utils/preprocessing.js`
14. `src/utils/selector_db.js`
15. `src/utils/site_helpers.js`
16. `src/utils/site_utils.js`

## Security Test Coverage

### Path Traversal Protection ✅
- Tests verify that path traversal attempts are blocked
- URL encoding attacks are handled
- Filenames are properly sanitized

### Binary File Security ✅
- Duplicate detection prevents resource exhaustion
- File size limits are enforced
- Content type verification is tested

### URL Validation ✅
- Invalid URL formats are tested
- JavaScript and file:// URLs are blocked
- Malformed URLs are handled gracefully

## Edge Cases Covered

### Progress Bar Edge Cases ✅
- maxPages = 0 (unlimited)
- maxPages = null
- maxPages = negative numbers
- Concurrent updates
- Progress bar errors during stop

### Binary File Edge Cases ✅
- Same content, different URLs
- Cross-domain duplicates
- Missing content-type headers
- Oversized files
- Network failures

### Document Link Extraction ✅
- Query parameters in URLs
- Malformed document URLs
- Duplicate links on same page
- Protocol-relative URLs

## Test Script Recommendations

Add the following npm scripts to package.json for easier testing:

```json
{
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
  "test:progress": "vitest run tests/unit/utils/progress.test.js",
  "test:binary": "vitest run tests/unit/services/crawl-service-binary-edge-cases.test.js",
  "test:errors": "vitest run tests/unit/utils/errors.test.js",
  "test:security": "vitest run tests/unit/utils/security.test.js"
}
```

## Known Test Failures

Several existing tests are failing due to:
1. Mock configuration issues
2. Path resolution problems 
3. Missing test fixtures
4. Outdated test expectations

These should be addressed in a separate PR focused on fixing test infrastructure.

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix failing tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Priority 2**: Add tests for missing coverage files listed above
3. **Priority 3**: Add integration tests for full crawl scenarios
4. **Priority 4**: Add performance benchmarking tests
5. **Priority 5**: Add visual regression tests for progress display

## Test Execution

To run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

To run specific test suites:
```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
```

To run with coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
