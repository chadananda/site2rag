# The Ocean Adventure

## Early Beginnings

The story of Ocean search begins with a simple desire to bridge the gap between traditional Bahá'í literature and the burgeoning digital world. My journey began with youth service at the Bahá'í World Center in Haifa, Israel, where we learned to use the Unix Grep tool to search the core Bahá'í library.

This was a daily exercise and it created a longing to have basic search tools for ongoing study.

## The India Chapter

A few years later, a personal turn of events led me to join my brother in India. It was here, amidst a different culture and environment, that the seeds for Ocean were sown.

I had already purchased an expensive scanner – a significant investment at the time – to start digitizing Bahá'í books. This was not just a task but a labor of love, driven by a commitment to digitize and share the rich heritage of Bahá'í literature.

## US Conversations

While visiting the USA, I had enlightening conversations with the head of the US Publishing Trust. At the time, they had plans to sell electronic versions of each book, but the emerging popularity of CDs suggested to me a different opportunity.

## Technical Development

While in India and China, and then India again, I immersed myself in learning Object Pascal through Delphi, an incredible tool for creating Windows applications. This was a time of growth and learning, driven by the goal of making Bahá'í texts more accessible.

When I approached Mr. Shah with the complete version of Ocean, aware of its potential controversy, his encouragement was a beacon: "If nobody is complaining, then you're not doing anything worthwhile. Go for it!"
