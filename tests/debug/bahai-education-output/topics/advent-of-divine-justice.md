description: "The Advent of Divine Justice is a letter written by Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, to the Bahá’ís of the United States and Canada in 1938. The letter was written in response to the growing community of Bahá'ís in the West and was intended to provide guidance on the spiritual and administrative development of the Bahá’í community. The letter was published in 1939 and is considered to be one of the most important letters of Shoghi Effendi on the ways and means required for the effective prosecution of 'Abdu'l-Baha's charter for teaching, the \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\"."
