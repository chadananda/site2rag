    <h1>Artificial Intelligence Overview</h1>

    <p>
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence
      displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any
      device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its
      goals.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The history of artificial intelligence began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings
      endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical
      philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the
      abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists
      to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.
    </p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>
    <p>
      AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix),
      understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (such as Tesla Autopilot), and competing at
      the highest level in strategic game systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the
      definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently
      excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
    </p>

    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the
      use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on
      sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly
      programmed to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering,
      speech recognition, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to
      perform the needed tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>Deep Learning</h2>
    <p>
      Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with
      representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks and
      convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, machine vision, speech
      recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation,
      bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs.
    </p>

    <h2>Ethics and Risks</h2>
    <p>
      The rapid development of AI has raised numerous ethical concerns. These include issues of bias, where AI systems
      may perpetuate or amplify existing societal biases present in their training data. There are also concerns about
      privacy, as AI systems often require large amounts of personal data to function effectively.
    </p>

    <p>
      The potential for AI to be used in autonomous weapons systems has led to calls for regulation and international
      agreements. Many experts have also raised concerns about the long-term risks of artificial general intelligence
      (AGI), which could potentially surpass human intelligence across all domains.
    </p>

    <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
    <p>
      The future of AI holds both tremendous promise and significant challenges. Researchers continue to work on
      developing more capable and efficient AI systems, with goals ranging from solving complex scientific problems to
      creating systems that can understand and interact with the world in human-like ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key areas of ongoing research include explainable AI, which aims to make AI decision-making more transparent and
      understandable to humans, and robust AI, which focuses on creating systems that perform reliably across a wide
      range of conditions and are resistant to adversarial attacks.
